# Whack-a-React 
Whack-a-React is a just for fun reaction time game combining the similar game play of Whack-A-Mole with the average reaction times of multiple age categories taken from a reaction time study conducted by the University of Michigan.
This is not an empirical scientific experiment but is just fun way to get an idea of how old your reaction times are! Are they older or younger than your actual age? Can you improve them? Do you notice any difference depending on what time of day it is?!

This is game for all ages and performance may vary between devices.

## Deployment 
This site was developed using [Gitpod IDE](https://www.gitpod.io/), committed to git and pushed to [GitHub.](https://github.com/join/get-started) 

### Deploying
To deploy this site to **GitHub** pages, the steps below were taken:

1. The developer logged into **GitHub.**
2. Once logged in, the desired repository was selected from the options available to the left of the screen **JanelleG51-Hannah-McNeish-Journalist**
3. From the possible options available, which included **Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights and Settings.** **Settings** was selected.
4. Once in **Settings**, scrolled down the page to **GitHub Pages**.
5. Under **Source**, clicked on the drop-down menu and changed the selection from **None** to **Master Branch**.
6. On selecting **Master Branch**, the page automatically refreshed and the site was deployed.
7. The deployed link then appeared in the **GitHub Pages** section. 

### Forking
Forking results in a **secondary branch** of the site being created. The **secondary branch** can be worked on simultaneously without the **Master Branch** being altered. The steps below should be followed:

1. Log into **GitHub.**
2. Select your desired repository from the options to the left.
3. From the options available at the top right of the screen, which include **Watch**, **Star** and **Fork**, select **Fork**.
4. A forked branch of the repository is then created. This is a copy of the repository up to the point the forked branch was created.
5. Changes can then be made in the forked repository without those changes taking effect in the **Master Branch**.
6. Both repositories can be merged by selecting **New Pull Request** from the original repository.

### Cloning
1. Log into **GitHub.**
2. Select your desired repository from the options to the left.
3. From the options available just above the commit list, which include **Go to File**, **Add File**, **Code** and **Gitpod**, select **Code**.
4. From the **HTTPS** tab, copy the **URL** for the repository.
5. Once in your **local IDE** open a new terminal.
6. Chose the working directory where you would like the cloned directory to be created.
7. Type **git clone** into the terminal and paste the **repository URL**.
8. Press **enter** to finish the cloning process.
